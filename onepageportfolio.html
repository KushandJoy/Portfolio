                Hi, I'm Monanu Joy Onyekachi - a passionate web developer who loves creating websites that are both 
                functional and visually appealing. <br> My journey into web development began on 6th of january 2025,
                sparked by simple curiosity. While rounding up at the university, I often found myself exploring countless websites for research purposes. Some were stunning and user-friendly, while others were clunky and hard to use. That contrast got me thinking. What makes a great website? <br>
                Driven by that question , i started digging deeper and that's when i discovered HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. What began as a curiosity soon became a passion. Since then, i've been committed to learning and building web experiences that not only look good but also work seamlessly. <br>
                  Here are few technologies i've been working with recently
